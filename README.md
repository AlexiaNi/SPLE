# SPLE


# Description

SPEL – Solar Powered Laser Engraver is a robot which can perform small to medium sized laser engravings on various  materials, such as: wood, aluminium, carbon fiber, leather and cardboard. Depending on the capacity at which it’s being used and the intensity of the diode, the engravings can be either decorative or functional. It uses a LiPo battery (which can be charged using solar energy) to power the 2 stepper motors.


Original contributions:  
  i)   Linear motion system  
  ii)  Powering system for the stepper motors  
  iii) Charge system for the LiPo batteries  
  iv)  Micro stepping
